    <h3>A Quick Introduction to Science!</h3>
    Science is defined as<br>
    <i>the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment</i><br>
    Because science itself is too broad, people separated the concept into more smaller ones such as physics and chemistry.<br>
    By studying more into science, we can know more about the world we live in.
